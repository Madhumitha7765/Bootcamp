# Test Specifications for Feature Publication

## Feature Publication Process
- **Objective:** Ensure that Data Scientists can successfully publish features on the Feature Mesh platform.
- **Inputs:** Feature name or keyword.
- **Expected Output:** Confirmation message upon successful publication.

## Input Validation
- **Objective:** Validate that controller methods correctly handle invalid inputs.
- **Inputs:** Missing required fields, invalid inputs.
- **Expected Output:** Proper handling of invalid inputs, appropriate error messages.

## Metadata Specification
- **Objective:** Validate that users can provide accurate metadata during the feature publication process.
- **Inputs:** Valid and invalid metadata (missing fields, invalid timestamp).
- **Expected Output:** Appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

## Status Message Display
- **Objective:** Verify that real-time status messages are displayed during the feature publication process.
- **Inputs:** Successful and unsuccessful publication attempts.
- **Expected Output:** Clear and concise messages indicating the status of the feature push operation.

## Error Handling
- **Objective:** Ensure the system handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.
- **Inputs:** Invalid metadata, technical issues during publication.
- **Expected Output:** Appropriate error messages, successful publication upon issue resolution.

## Integration Testing - CRUD Operations
- **Objective:** Test all CRUD operations (CreateAsync, GetAsync, AddFeatureAsync, DeleteAsync) to ensure correct interaction with the Feature Mesh repository.
- **Inputs:** Feature data for creation, valid and invalid IDs for retrieval and deletion.
- **Expected Output:** Successful creation, retrieval, and deletion; appropriate handling of invalid IDs.

## Validating Insertion of Feature into database
- **Objective:** Ensure that the `CreateAsync` method in the `MongoDBService` class correctly inserts a new feature into the MongoDB collection.
- **Inputs:** MongoDB mock settings, mock feature collection, mock service, feature object
- **Expected Output:** Successful insertion into mongodb.

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task CreateAsync_ShouldInsertFeature()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockSettings = new Mock<IOptions<MongoDBSettings>>();
    var mockCollection = new Mock<IMongoCollection<Feature>>();
    var service = new MongoDBService(mockSettings.Object);
    var feature = new Feature { Id = "1", username = "testUser", movieIds = new List<string> { "movie1", "movie2" } };
 
    // Act
    await service.CreateAsync(feature);
 
    // Assert
    mockCollection.Verify(m => m.InsertOneAsync(feature, It.IsAny<InsertOneOptions>(), It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()), Times.Once);

}
```


## HTTP Responses
- **Objective:** Verify that controller methods return correct HTTP status codes and response bodies.
- **Inputs:** Successful and unsuccessful feature publication attempts.
- **Expected Output:** Correct HTTP status codes, response bodies, and confirmation messages.
