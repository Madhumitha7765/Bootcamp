### Publish Feature Test Suite

#### Test Case 1: Data Scientist Successfully Publishes a Feature

**Given** the Data Scientist is logged into the Feature Mesh platform  
**When** a new feature named "new_feature" is developed and ready for publication  
**And** the Data Scientist initiates the feature publication process  
**And** provides metadata for the feature (feature name: "new_feature", keywords: "keyword1, keyword2", timestamp: "2024-02-28")  
**And** chooses to publish the feature using the GUI  
**Then** the system should display real-time status messages for the feature push operation  
**And** when the feature publication is successful  
**Then** the system should confirm the addition of the feature to the Feature Mesh repository  
**And** provide a success message to the Data Scientist  

#### Test Case 2: Data Scientist Encounters an Issue During Feature Publication

**Given** the Data Scientist is logged into the Feature Mesh platform  
**And** a new feature is developed and ready for publication  
**When** the Data Scientist initiates the feature publication process  
**And** provides metadata for the feature (feature name: "error_feature", keywords: "error_keyword", timestamp: "2024-02-28")  
**And** encounters an issue during the publication process  
**Then** the system should display an appropriate error message  
**And** when the error is resolved, the Data Scientist retries the feature publication  
**Then** the system should successfully publish the feature  
**And** confirm the addition to the Feature Mesh repository

### Fetch Feature Test Suite

#### Test Case 3: Data Scientist Searches for a Feature by Feature Name

**Given** the Data Scientist is on the GUI search page  
**When** they enter the feature name "searched_feature" in the search field  
**And** submit the search query  
**Then** they should see the published feature "searched_feature" along with its abstract  

#### Test Case 4: Data Scientist Searches for Features Based on Keywords in Abstract

**Given** the Data Scientist is on the GUI search page  
**When** they enter keywords "keyword1, keyword2" in the search field  
**And** submit the search query  
**Then** they should see a list of features containing the keywords in their abstracts  
**And** each feature should display its name and abstract  

#### Test Case 5: Data Scientist Searches for Features Based on Timestamp

**Given** the Data Scientist is on the GUI search page  
**When** they enter a timestamp "2024-02-28" in the search field  
**And** submit the search query  
**Then** they should see a list of features published on the specified date  
**And** each feature should display its name and abstract  

#### Test Case 6: Data Scientist Downloads a Feature in Published Format

**Given** the Data Scientist is viewing the details of a feature named "download_feature"  
**When** they choose to download the feature in .xlsx format  
**Then** the feature data should be downloaded in the .xlsx format  

#### Test Case 7: Model Fetches Feature from Offline Store

**Given** the model is in training mode  
**When** it makes a call with the parameter as the feature name "offline_feature", "offline", file format("csv")  
**Then** it should receive the feature in the published format from the offline store  

#### Test Case 8: Model Fetches Feature from Online Store

**Given** the deployed model is in production  
**When** it makes a call with the parameter as the feature name "online_feature", "online", file format("xlsx")  
**Then** it should receive the feature in the published format from the online store  

These test suites provide detailed scenarios with specific values for both the "Publish Feature" and "Fetch Feature" functionalities.
